# Introduction

## Wireless network basic components

* **Wireless host** - typical end-device, on which apps run (e.g. laptop,
    tablet, smartphone or desktop computer).
* **Wireless communication link** - depending on used technology, wireless
    links may differ in context of range and speed. Its main task is to connect
    end-devices or other network peripherals (e.g. routers, switches).
* **Base station** - a key element of wireless network infrastructure, which is
    responsible of data (i.e. packets) transmission and reception between base 
    station and connected end-devices (i.e. wireless hosts).
* **Network infrastructure** - generally bigger network to which wireless hosts
    are connected.
