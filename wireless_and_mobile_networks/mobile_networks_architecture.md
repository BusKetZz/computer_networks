# Mobile Networks Architecture



## GSM - Global System for Mobile Communications

GSM (initially known as *Groupe Special Mobile*) was the result of the 
European need to build pan-European digital mobile network system, which would
have replaced old and incompatible analog systems.

GSM was implemented in the early 90s and became the main standard in the world
of mobile networks. Nowadays, 80% of subscribers of mobile networks use GSM
technology.
